    // PlaceBlockEvent(@Nullable ItemStack itemInHand, @Nonnull Vector3i targetBlock, @Nonnull RotationTuple rotation)
    // It extends CancellableEcsEvent.
    
    // CancellableEcsEvent usually has getEntity() or similar?
    // Let me check CancellableEcsEvent docs if I can.
    // If not, I'll rely on global listeners often passing the entity context or look for another event.
    
    /* 
       Wait, if PlaceBlockEvent is an ECS event, it's dispatched *on* the entity.
       But I'm registering a global listener?
       "this.getEventRegistry().registerGlobal(PlaceBlockEvent.class, ...)"
       Passes the event.
       
       If it's an ECS event, usually we register it in a System:
       "registerSystem(new OutputSystem())"
       
       Let's implement it as a System instead of a Handler to be safe and efficient?
